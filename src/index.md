          Ever felt like you're chasing shadows? Debugging incidents without
          observability is just that. Imagine it's 2 AM - you're squinting at
          logs trying to figure out why your app just tanked. Not fun, right?


          Observability transforms your bug hunt into a guided tour. No more
          guesswork, just straight answers. And yes, you can actually sleep
          peacefully at night.
