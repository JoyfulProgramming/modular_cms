    subheading: A few reasons why you should improve observability
    features:
      - heading: Fix Bugs Faster
        summary: Observability lets you catch issues the moment they happen. It's like having X-ray vision for your app, so you can fix problems before they mess with your users' experience. No more guessing games—just quick, effective solutions.

      - heading: Find Performance Bottlenecks
        summary: Observability helps you see where you can speed things up and make everything run smoother. Your users will notice the difference, and they'll keep coming back because they trust your app to perform.
        icon: solid-award
      - heading: Less Incidents, Less Stress
        summary: Observability gives you the power to set alerts that warn you about potential issues before they blow up. It's like having a crystal ball for your app's health, letting you stay ahead of the game and keep everything running smoothly.

    features:
      - heading: Diagnosing Incidents Takes Hours
        subheading: Ever felt like you're chasing shadows? Debugging incidents without observability is just that. Imagine it's 2 AM - you're squinting at logs trying to figure out why your app just tanked. Not fun, right? Observability transforms your bug hunt into a guided tour. No more guesswork, just straight answers. And yes, you can actually sleep peacefully at night.

      - heading: App Health Is a Mystery
        subheading: You're driving blindfolded. That's you managing a Rails app without observability. System health? A big question mark. CPU spikes, memory leaks, and you’re none the wiser until your app slows to a crawl—or worse, crashes.
        icon: solid-heart
      - heading: Improving Performance Is A Wild Goose Chase
        subheading: Performance bottlenecks are sneaky, and without the right tools, they're nearly invisible. Trying to connect a profiler to a Rails app in production? Good luck with that. Even if you can figure out the slow areas of the app, without observability you can't accurately determine **why** they're slow.
        icon: solid-question-circle
      - heading: Background Jobs Are A Black Box
        subheading: Those background jobs you rely on? They can fail silently and spectacularly. Without observability, you won’t know until it’s too late. Emails undelivered, reports half-baked—chaos ensues.

      - heading: Speechless with how easy this was to integrate
        content: >-
          I recently got my hands on Flowbite Pro, and holy crap, I'm speechless with how easy this was to integrate within my application.  Most templates are a pain, code is scattered, and near impossible to theme.  Flowbite has code in one place and I'm not joking when I say it took me a matter of minutes to copy the code, customise it and integrate within a Laravel + Vue application.  If you care for your time, I hands down would go with this.

      - heading: Solid foundation for any project
        content: FlowBite provides a robust set of design tokens and components based on the popular Tailwind CSS framework. From the most used UI components like forms and navigation bars to the whole app screens designed both for desktop and mobile, this UI kit provides a solid foundation for any project. Designing with Figma components that can be easily translated to the utility classes of Tailwind CSS is a huge timesaver!

        content: "As someone who mainly designs in the browser, I've been a casual user of Figma, but as soon as I saw and started playing with FlowBite my mind was. Everything is so well structured and simple to use (I've learnt so much about Figma by just using the toolkit). Aesthetically, the well designed components are beautiful and will undoubtedly level up your next application."
